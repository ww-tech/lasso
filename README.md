Lasso is an iOS application architecture for building discrete, composable and testable components both big and small - from single one-off screens, through complex flows, to high-level application structures.



## Why Lasso?

Without a set of structural principles, it's very easy for an application's code base to become hard to both reason about, and maintain.  In particular, these problems will eventually arise:

- tight coupling of components makes it hard to change/test things
- business logic living in strange places makes it hard to modify/reuse/debug/test existing code
- view presentation choices made in inappropriate places makes it hard to refactor/reorganize/test flows
- inconsistent organization across team makes it hard to cross-contribute



## The Lasso way

Lasso encourages a strong separation of concerns by clearly defining discrete, single-responsibility components where specific types of code should live, and a clear, flexible way for these components to communicate.  Larger units of behavior are easily composed, and re-composed.

### Screens

We generally think of a screen as a single page/view in an app - e.g., a login view, a contacts list view, an audio settings view, etc.

In Lasso, a `Screen` is the collection of types used to implement a single view:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/screen.svg" width="75%" alt="Diagram of a Screen and its constituent parts" /></p>

The `View` (i.e., a `UIViewController`) is responsible for:

- accurately rendering the current `State` (i.e., the content) of the screen
- forwarding user interactions to the `Store` (i.e., the decision maker)
- responding to state changes to keep the presentation up to date

Lasso views tend to be small, with practically zero logic in them.

A **unidirectional data flow** is used to ensure consistency: a `View` never re-renders anything in direct response to a user action.  `Views` send `Actions` to the `Store`, which updates the `State`, which come back to the `View` as `State` change notifications.

The `Store` is where a screen's decisions are made, and is the source of truth for the screen's `State`.  A `Store` is responsible for:

- all business logic for the screen
- responding to `Actions` (i.e. events sent from the `View`)
- updates to the screen's `State`

A `Store` can also generate an `Output` when an event occurs that is more appropriately handled elsewhere.  E.g., a login screen might generate a "user did login" output as a signal to a higher-level system to move to a logged-in portion of an app; or a contact list screen might generate a "did select contact" output as a signal to a higher-level flow to either present or push a contact detail screen.

### Flows

A `Flow` represents a feature - or area - of an app, and is commonly composed of a collection of `Screens`.  For example, a "new user" flow might be composed of a series of one-time informational screens followed by a single "let's get started" screen.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/flow.svg" width="80%" min-width="300" alt="Diagram of a Flow" /></p>

A `Flow` is instantiated and started within an appropriate context of a view hierarchy (e.g., a "sign up" flow might be presented on a menu screen, or a "welcome" flow might be pushed onto a navigation stack).  The `Flow` starts by creating its initial `Screen`, and listens for `Output` signals.  As `Outputs` arrive, the `Flow` decides what to do with them - it can create and place another `Screen` into the view hierarchy, emit its own `Output` (when an event occurs that is more appropriately handled elsewhere), or whatever is appropriate for the `Flow`.

Since `Screens` and `Flows` are encapsulated modules with discrete entry and exit points, it's quite easy and common for a `Flow` to manage both `Screens` _and_ `Flows`.  In this way, it becomes possible to define your application as a hierarchy of components, reducing complexity from the top level down.

## Requirements

Lasso supports **iOS 13 and up**, and can be compiled with **Swift 4.2 and up**.

Note: Lasso v.1.3.0 has added support for SwiftUI, and has a minimum deployment target of iOS 13.0.  If you need support for earlier versions of iOS, please use v1.2.1.



## Installation

### Cocoapods

The core Lasso framework is added to the primary target in your Podfile:

```ruby
Pod 'Lasso'
```

Also add `LassoTestUtilities` to your test target(s):

```ruby
Pod 'LassoTestUtilities'
```



### Swift Package Manager

The Lasso package URL is:

```
`https://github.com/ww-tech/lasso.git`
```

For sample usage, see: [Swift Package Manager Sample](Example/SwiftPM/ReadMe.md).



### Tuist

To add `Lasso` as a *tuist* `TargetDependency`:
* clone this repo to the preferred location
* create a `.project` dependency
* add the dependency to your target dependency

```swift
let lasso: TargetDependency = .project(target: "Lasso", path: "../../path-to-lasso-repo-clone/")

let demo = Target(
    name: "Demo",
    platform: .iOS,
    product: .framework,
    bundleId: "com.example.Demo",
    dependencies: [ lasso ]
)
```

Also add `LassoTestUtilities` to your test target(s):

```swift
let lassoTestUtilities: TargetDependency = .project(target: "LassoTestUtilities", path: "../../path-to-lasso-repo-clone/")

let demoTests = Target(
    name: "DemoTests",
    platform: .iOS,
    product: .unitTests,
    bundleId: "com.example.DemoTests",
    dependencies: [ LassoTestUtilities ]
)
```
